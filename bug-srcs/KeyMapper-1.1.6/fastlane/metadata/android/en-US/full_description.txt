'''What can be remapped?'''
    ONLY HARDWARE buttons can be remapped.

    There is NO GUARANTEE any of these buttons will work and this app isn't
    designed to control games. Your device's OEM/vendor can prevent them from being
    remapped.

    * Volume buttons.
    * Navigation buttons.
    * Bluetooth/wired keyboards and mice connected to your device.
    * Buttons on other connected devices should also work.

    You can combine multiple keys to form a "trigger" and have as many triggers as
    you want for each action. You can make a key map only work on a long press as
    well and to vibrate as well.

    '''What canâ€™t be remapped?'''
    * Pixel Active Edge
    * OnePlus Alert Slider
    * Power button
    * Bixby button

    Your key maps don't work if the screen is OFF.

    '''What can I remap my keys to do?'''
    Some actions will only work on rooted devices and specific Android versions.

    * Open an app
    * Open an app shortcut. This feature is very useful since you can tell another
    app to do something Key Mapper canâ€™t. E.g If your launcher has a shortcut to
    open the app drawer, you can select that shortcut in this app and make any
    button open the app drawer.

    * Go back
    * Go home
    * Open recents
    * Open menu
    * Expand notification drawer
    * Expand quick settings
    * Collapse status bar
    * Toggle/enable/disable WiFi
    * Toggle/enable/disable Bluetooth
    * Toggle/enable/disable mobile data (ROOT only)
    * Toggle Play/pause media
    * Pause/play media
    * Fast forward/rewind
    * Next/previous track
    * Volume up/down
    * Increase/decrease a specific volume stream
    * Show the volume dialog
    * Cycle through and change the ringer mode
    * Mute/unmute/toggle mute (Android 6.0+)
    * Toggle/enable/disable auto-rotate
    * Switch between portrait and landscape mode
    * Force portrait/landscape mode
    * Toggle/enable/disable auto-brightness
    * Increase/decrease brightness
    * Toggle/enable/disable flashlight (Android 6.0+)
    * Take a screenshot (Android 9.0+)
    * Open the Google Assistant
    * Open camera
    * Consume key event. (Do nothing)
    * Lock the device
    * Move the cursor to the end of a file
    * Toggle, show and hide the keyboard
    * Show the keyboard picker (ROOT only for Android 8.1+)

    The Key Mapper keyboard needs to be selected for these to work and you canâ€™t
    use a soft keyboard at the same time:
    * Input a specific keycode
    * Input a key
    * Insert a block of text

    More will be added. If you have any ideas, leave a comment or email the
    developer. ðŸ˜ƒ

    '''What other things can the app do?'''
    * Option to show a persistent notification which can pause/resume your keymaps.
    It can also open the accessibility settings on the device to enable/disable the
    service. Rooted devices can start/stop the accessibility service without going
    into settings and just tap the notification.
    * Automatically change the keyboard to the Key Mapper one and/or show the
    keyboard picker when a chosen Bluetooth device is connected and switch back to
    the old one when it is disconnected.

    '''Permissisons'''
    You don't have to grant all the permissions for the app to work. The app will
    tell you if a permission needs to be granted for a feature to work.

    * Accessibility Service: Basic requirement for remapping to work. It is needed
    so the app can listen to and block keyevents.
    * Device Admin: To turn the screen off when using the action to turn off the
    screen
    * Modify System Settings: To change the brightness and rotation settings
    * Camera: To control the flashlight

    On some devices, enabling the accessibility service will disable "enhanced data
    encryption".
