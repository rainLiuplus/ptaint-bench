Spanish translation added, thanks to Diego Sanguinetti (sguinetti).
Chinese translation fixed, thanks to sr093906.
It's now possible to use the file history to open files faster.
It's now possible to add a large amount of text by editing a single line (deleting remains line by line, there is no possibility to edit lines in bulk mode either).

Note: As I've made changes since the Spanish translation, two or three additions are made with DeepL.
